This repository contains two files: Northwind schema and template for learners
Use your MySQL Workbench and execute the contents of northwind_schema.sql to:
Create all the tables
Insert sample data
Once the schema is loaded:
Open template_for_learners.sql
Run the file in the same Northwind database
This will execute all your queries, question by question.
